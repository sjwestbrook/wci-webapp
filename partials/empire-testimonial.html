    <p>While waiting for an appointment with Empire, Carol Wagenson, Workforce Development Manager for Workforce Connections, Inc.,
browsed through the company newsletter that highlighted Empire’s commitment to their core values: Respect, Integrity, Responsibility,
Continual Improvement and Knowledge. These corporate values have rung true throughout the experience with Empire. </p>
 
    <p>Doug Billings, Vice-President of Marketing, and Alexis Marsh, Customer Service Manager, indicated that partnering with Workforce Connections, Inc. is a great way to invest in the community without a substantial cost up-front while making an impact on someone’s life. Empire provides work experience opportunities with flexible, part-time hours. Shawn, a Workforce Connections Inc. client, was looking for the opportunity to get reaccustomed to the workforce. His work experience through Wisconsin’s FoodShare Employment and Training (FSET) program enabled Shawn to learn job skills that included file retention and assistance with Shipping and Receiving. A work experience provides the opportunity to become more marketable by learning new skills. When the worksite opportunity came to an end with FSET, Shawn applied for a full-time position. Although Empire knew that Shawn did not have all the skills to perform the job, they recognized his willingness to learn and agreed that he was a good fit. Workforce Connections, Inc. enrolled Shawn into an on-the-job training program through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, (WIOA) which provided the resources for Shawn to receive the necessary training to become proficient in his new job and minimized the cost of training for Empire.  </p>

    <p>Shawn reports that Empire has treated him very well by being professional, courteous, respectful and willing to teach him the skills he needs to know. The work experience gave Shawn the necessary skills needed to become a marketable candidate; the on-the-job training experience has given Shawn the training he needs to be a productive employee. </p>
